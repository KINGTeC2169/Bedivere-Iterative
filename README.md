# Bedivere_Iterative
KING TeC's 2017 Robot Programmed in the KT-Iterative Framework.  This is the first publicly released use of the Royal-Iterative framework (an outdated version of the framework, with many major updates being released after the completion of this project), and shows the general use-cases of the API.  Feel free to reference, share, or copy this code for your own use!
Note: This code was written in the off-season as a learning project, and does not contain any autonomous software and was never used in any offical FIRST competitions.
